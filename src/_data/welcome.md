Fourteen years ago when we rescued two very sick little girls, God called upon our hearts ‚ù§ to open Beautiful Gate Orphanage. That dream is now a fully functional orphanage dedicated to abandoned special-needs children, whom we call Fragile Butterflies ü¶ã. We deeply love ‚ù§ them and they bless us abundantly.

In partnership with you, we can and are making a difference for them!
