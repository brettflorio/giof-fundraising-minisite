## So every dollar you give will be doubled!

You can help us by giving your tax-deductible gift in four ways:

Go to the [DONATION ITEMS](#products) below and select an item.

1. Click on that item to donate online!
1. Or, if you want to donate a certain amount directly to the general fund, [please click here to support GIOF](http://giof.org/support_giof/).
1. You can also avoid the computer and send a check made out to GIOF, and send it to GIOF, PO Box 6458, Chula Vista, CA 91909
1. If possible, please consider making your gift a monthly online pledge.

Most of the donation items below show two options for payment: a full-price cost, or a monthly pledge, paying 1/12 each month.

Thank you.
